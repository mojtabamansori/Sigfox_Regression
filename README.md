# sigfox_regression
Hello
In this project, we are working on the SigFox data set that was collected in Italy. This data includes 137 gateways, which we received their RSSi data, and apart from this data, there are also lat and long networks.

The files contain three parts:

1- Pre-processing (start with "PRE")

2- Models (start with "M")

3- Charts (start with "P")
